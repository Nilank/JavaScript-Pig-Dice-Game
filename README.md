# JavaScript-Pig-Dice-Game
It is my first self project which I did apart my Academic projects. In this project I tried to make a game using Javascript. The code is simple and easy written neatly.

I used CSS too to make the game attractive and responsive. As to make the game simple and understandable neither frameworks
nor libraries of Javascript are used.


The game inputs are not hardcoded whereas they are manipulated using Javascript using DOM.

**Game Rules**

*The game has 2 players, playing in rounds*

*In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score*

*BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn*

*The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn*

*The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game*


While completing this project I've taken the course of Javascript under the Instructor **Jonas Schmedtmann**.
This project would not have been possible without his commendable lessons and good teaching skills.
